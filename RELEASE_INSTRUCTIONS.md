## What's Ready

✅ **Version Information Updated**: Assembly version has been updated to 1.0.0.0 for the first release.

✅ **Build Artifacts Available**:

✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Configured**: GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically create releases when version tags are pushed.

## How to Create the First Release

### Option 1: Automatic Release (Recommended)
Once this PR is merged, create and push a version tag to trigger automatic release:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build the application on Windows and Linux
- Create a GitHub release
- Upload build artifacts
- Package everything in a zip file

### Option 2: Manual Release
If you prefer to create a manual release:

1. Download the compiled artifacts from the successful build
2. Create a new release on GitHub at: https://github.com/souhaiebtar/Caffeine/releases/new
3. Set tag version to `v1.0.0`
4. Upload the `Caffeine.exe` and `Caffeine.exe.config` files
