# Caffeine App Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. New Application Icon
- **Old Icon**: `energydrink.ico` - Energy drink themed icon
- **New Icon**: `caffeine.ico` - Modern coffee cup with steam effect
- **Features**: Multi-resolution ICO file supporting 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 pixels
- **Design**: Coffee cup with brown/tan colors and white steam wisps

### 2. Build System Improvements
- Fixed C# syntax compatibility issues for cross-platform building
- Replaced C# 7.2+ `in` parameters with `ref` parameters for broader compatibility
- Removed `readonly` modifier where necessary to support `ref` usage
- Verified build works on both Windows (MSBuild) and Linux (mono/xbuild)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic builds on push to master and pull requests
  - Windows build using MSBuild
  - Linux build using Mono (fallback to xbuild)
  - Automatic release creation when version tags are pushed
  - Artifact uploads for both builds
  - Release packages include both `.exe` and configuration files

## Testing the Build

### Local Build (Linux with Mono)
```bash
xbuild Caffeine.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

### Local Build (Windows with MSBuild)
```bash
msbuild Caffeine.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
```

### Output Location
- Executable: `bin/Release/Caffeine.exe`
- Configuration: `bin/Release/Caffeine.exe.config`

## Release Process

1. Create a version tag: `git tag v1.2.0`
2. Push the tag: `git push origin v1.2.0`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the application
   - Create a release
   - Upload the executable files
   - Package everything in a zip file
